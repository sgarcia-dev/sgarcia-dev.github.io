Be it by learning development as a profession from scratch, learning a new tool or framework, or simply furthering your skills. </p> <p> But unlike a teacher or instructor, a mentor's role is more passive. A mentor will not provide you with lectures, or material. But instead, he will guide you through what you learn, get you unstuck, and offer advice based on his/her years of expertise. </p> <p> Because this also means you will be doing most of the work, an unexpected benefit of hiring a mentor is you become self-guided and autonomous as a developer. Which often translates to succesful leadership positions early on. </p> </section> <section> <h3 class="mt-5">Benefits of hiring a mentor</h3> <h6>How I can help you</h6> <ul class="mt-4"> <li> <i>Providing direction.</i> While being self taught is great, it can be a frustrating experience not knowing what to learn next and in what order to become a proficient developer in the most time efficient manner. I can guide you. </li> <li> <i>Diminish frustration</i>. A common problem with being self taught, is the demoralizing experience that comes when you can't solve even simple problems despite hours of troubleshooting, and have nobody to ask for help. I can be that support, and provide plenty of techniques to quickly troubleshoot problems. </li> <li> <i>Building a portfolio.</i> What should be the simple task of building a portfolio of projects, often snowballs out of control with questions like: What should I build? What if it becomes too complex? How do I build it?. And ends up with you building 0 projects. I can help you come up with realistic portfolio ideas, scope them, and build them following industry best practices. </li> <li> <i>Save time.</i> There is no such thing as the perfect resource to learn coding, and you can waste a lot of time with poor quality material online. I can reduce this time wastage by helping you find quality learning material quickly. </li> <li> <i>Stand out from the crowd.</i> I can do this by sharing with you my ample interview expertise both as an applicant, and interviewer who reviews candidates for web development positions on a daily basis. </li> </ul> </section> <section> <h3 class="mt-5">My Skillset</h3> <h6>What i can teach you</h6> <ul class="mt-4"> <li> Front End Development <ul> <li>JavaScript <i class="devicon-javascript-plain"></i></li> <li>HTML <i class="devicon-html5-plain"></i></li> <li>CSS <i class="devicon-css3-plain"></i></li> <li>Responsive Design</li> <li>Accesibility</li> <li>Performance Optimization <i class="devicon-chrome-plain"></i></li> <li> Tooling <ul> <li>Sass / Less <i class="devicon-sass-plain"></i> <i class="devicon-less-plain-wordmark"></i></li> <li>Babel <i class="devicon-babel-plain"></i></li> <li>Webpack <i class="devicon-webpack-plain"></i></li> </ul> </li> <li> Frameworks <ul> <li>React <i class="devicon-react-original"></i></li> <li>Vue.js <i class="devicon-vuejs-plain"></i></li> <li>Angular <i class="devicon-angularjs-plain"></i></li> <li>State Management w/Redux & Vuex</li> <li>Routing</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li> Back End Development <ul> <li>Node</li> <li>Express</li> <li>Authentication w/Passport</li> <li>Session Management via JWTs</li> <li>NoSQL Databases w/Mongo</li> <li>SQL Databases w/Postgres</li> <li>GraphQL w/Apollo</li> </ul> </li> <li> DevOps and Misc <ul> <li>Terminal/Bash</li> <li>Unit Testing</li> <li>Automation Testing w/Selenium & Puppeteer</li> <li>Task Automation w/Grunt, Gulp & Webpack</li> <li>Version Control w/Git <i class="devicon-git-plain"></i></li> <li>Deployment</li> <li>Agiñe & Scrum</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </section> <section> <h3 class="mt-5">Mentorship vs Bootcamps</h3> <h6>Which one is the best fit for me?</h6> <p class="mt-4"> Bootcamps are a fantastic way to accelerate your learning and get into the web development industry. However, you are then faced with the challenging decision of picking the correct one for you. And even <i>if</i> you pick the correct one, there are still 2 main factors you should consider before joining a bootcamp: </p> <ul> <li> <i>Classroom group environments aren't great to get all the attention you need.</i> While classroom group bootcamps are often cheap, these come with the drawback you won't ever really get the instructor's full attention. As it will be divided between the group members. <ul> <li><i>How I can help:</i> I offer personalized, direct 1:1 on an on-demand basis. No distractions.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <i>One-size-fits-all solutions don't always work, and go out of date quickly.</i> A common issue with a lot of programs is that they are faced with the challenge of predicting how every person will perform across a pre-defined list of resources. Everyone learns differently, and as such, what one person finds easy, another might find impossible to understand. Not to mention technology changes so fast, course material often goes out of date before they even have the chance to respond to the change. <ul> <li><i>How I can help:</i> I can tailor an up-to-date, custom learning plan to your specific needs <i>as</i> you are completing the program.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <i>Bootcamps are often rigid and lack flexibility.</i> A point that is strongly related to the point above, building a One-size-fits-all solution requires that you estimate how long each student will take to graduate. And the end result, is often programs that are extremely easy to complete and graduate on tiem, but with very low value market-wise. Or challenging programs with high market-value, but incredibly high student drop-out rates due to the challenging nature of the course. <ul> <li><i>How I can help:</i> With me, there are no hard <i>deadlines</i>. We move at your own pace. I know how life gets in the way sometimes, so we can adjust your goals as your availability changes.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </section> <section> <h3 class="mt-5">Interested?</h3> <h6>Get in touch</h6> <a href="/contact.html"> <button class="mt-4 mb-5 btn btn-primary">Contact Me</button> </a> </section> </main> <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js" integrity="sha384-q8i/X+965DzO0rT7abK41JStQIAqVgRVzpbzo5smXKp4YfRvH+8abtTE1Pi6jizo" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.14.7/umd/popper.min.js" integrity="sha384-UO2eT0CpHqdSJQ6hJty5KVphtPhzWj9WO1clHTMGa3JDZwrnQq4sF86dIHNDz0W1" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/js/bootstrap.min.js" integrity="sha384-JjSmVgyd0p3pXB1rRibZUAYoIIy6OrQ6VrjIEaFf/nJGzIxFDsf4x0xIM+B07jRM" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="/particles.9cdd61b3.js"></script>
